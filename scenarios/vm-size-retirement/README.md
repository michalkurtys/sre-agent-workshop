# Scenario: VM Size Retirement (SKU Discontinuation)

> Scenario: `vm-size-retirement` · Azure Virtual Machines

Run every command below from the repository root. This capsule owns its
infrastructure, scenario lifecycle, investigation, approval gate, and output.

## Cost profile

The **high** profile is a qualitative cost estimate. The dominant cost drivers
are two Windows virtual machines, Standard Azure Bastion, Application Insights
and Log Analytics ingestion, and Azure SRE Agent usage. Confirm current pricing
for your deployment region before provisioning, and run cleanup immediately
after completing the scenario.

## Scenario

Azure is retiring the Dv2/DSv2 VM families. The injector creates three
deallocated VMs on the retiring SKUs and emits a realistic advisory. The SRE
Agent inventories all affected VMs with Azure Resource Graph, preserving the
retirement deadline and ownership tags as incident evidence.

The injector **simulates** the advisory kickoff. Azure Service Health events
cannot be injected on demand. In a production environment, use the documented,
standalone [Service Health Activity Log alert](./infra/bicep/service-health-alert.bicep)
to route real Service Health events to an incident intake. It is a production
reference only: `main.bicep` does not import or deploy it as a scenario alert.

## Capsule commands

```bash
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/setup.sh
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/inject.sh
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/tools/invoke-vm-investigation.sh
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/validate.sh
```

```powershell
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/setup.ps1
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/inject.ps1
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/tools/Invoke-VmInvestigation.ps1
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/validate.ps1
```

The validator intentionally fails until every retiring VM is migrated.

## Recovery contract

Normal remediation is approval-gated. The SRE Agent investigates and proposes
the fleet resize, but it never performs the action. An authorized operator
must supply a valid `CHG-<number>` or `INC-<number>` ticket and type exactly
`APPROVE` at the local gate:

```bash
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/tools/invoke-approved-remediation.sh \
  --action migrate-vm-size --change-ticket CHG-12345
```

```powershell
./scenarios/vm-size-retirement/scripts/tools/Invoke-ApprovedRemediation.ps1 `
  -Action migrate-vm-size -ChangeTicket CHG-12345
```

The gate runs only `migrate-vm-size`, resizes the full retiring-SKU fleet, and
records execution in `output/actions-audit.log`. Validate after the approved
action completes.
