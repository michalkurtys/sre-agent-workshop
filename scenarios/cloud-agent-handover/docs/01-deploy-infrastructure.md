# Module 1: Run local setup

Run one setup script from the root of your generated repository. Setup is local;
there is no infrastructure deployment workflow to trigger.

## Bash

Use the defaults (`eastus2`, workload `srelabapp`):

```bash
scenarios/cloud-agent-handover/scripts/setup.sh
```

Or choose supported values:

```bash
scenarios/cloud-agent-handover/scripts/setup.sh \
  --location swedencentral \
  --workload myhandover
```

## PowerShell 7

Use the defaults:

```powershell
scenarios/cloud-agent-handover/scripts/setup.ps1
```

Or choose supported values:

```powershell
scenarios/cloud-agent-handover/scripts/setup.ps1 `
  -Location swedencentral `
  -Workload myhandover
```

## What setup does

The script:

1. Checks the required tools, Azure login, GitHub login, generated repository,
   and Copilot assignability.
2. Registers the required Azure resource providers.
3. Creates `rg-<workload>`.
4. Deploys a B1 Linux App Service, workspace-based Application Insights and Log
   Analytics, and the scenario alert.
5. Removes the former GitHub OIDC identity, role assignment, and credential
   variables when rerunning over an older deployment.
6. Tests, publishes, and deploys the .NET 10 application with the signed-in
   Azure CLI user.
7. Writes repository metadata variables for the resource group, web app,
   location, and workload name.

At completion it prints values in this form:

```text
Application: https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net
Health:      https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net/health
Repository:  <owner>/<repository>
```

Save the application URL for later modules.

## Troubleshooting

### Source template rejected

If setup says the repository is still a template, return to GitHub, select
**Use this template**, clone the generated repository, and run setup in the
generated repository. Current setup output says:

`Use the template, clone the generated repository, and run setup in the generated repository.`

### Copilot is not assignable

Enable GitHub Copilot coding agent for the repository and confirm that your
account or organization policy permits issue assignment. Then rerun setup.

### GitHub Actions variables are denied

Setup uses the active GitHub CLI credential. In Codespaces, it preserves the
authenticated `GITHUB_TOKEN`; do not unset it. Run `gh auth status`, then
rerun setup. The active credential needs permission to manage Actions variables
in the generated repository.

### Legacy role assignment removal is denied

This applies only when rerunning setup over a deployment created by the former
OIDC workflow. Removing its Website Contributor assignment requires **Owner**
or **User Access Administrator** at the resource-group scope or broader. Ask an
administrator to remove the assignment, or delete the old scenario resource
group and run setup again for a fresh deployment.

### Provider registration fails

Inspect the required providers:

```bash
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Web --query registrationState -o tsv
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Insights --query registrationState -o tsv
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights --query registrationState -o tsv
```

Register any provider that is not `Registered`:

```bash
az provider register --namespace <provider-name> --wait
```

Next: [Verify the application](./02-deploy-application.md).
