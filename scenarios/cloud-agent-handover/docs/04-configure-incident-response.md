# Module 4: Configure incident response

The App Service handover needs both GitHub integrations: the Code connection
from Module 3 and a GitHub connector configured with a PAT for issue access.

## Connect GitHub issue access

In the SRE Agent connector settings, add the **GitHub OAuth connector** for the
generated repository. Follow [Set up the GitHub
connector](../../../docs/connect-github-to-sre-agent.md#configure-the-github-oauth-connector-for-issue-handoff).

Verify access with a read-only request in an agent chat:

```text
List recent issues from <owner>/<repository> and summarize the top 3.
```

The agent should either list issues or safely report that none exist.

## Create the review plan

Create one response plan for this alert. Azure Monitor is the incident
platform for this scenario.

If a default `quickstart` response plan exists, open **Builder** → **Incident
response plans**, switch to **Table view**, and delete it. Leaving that plan
enabled can route the same alert twice or to the wrong custom agent.

1. Open **Builder** → **Agent Canvas**, select **Create**, then select
   **Trigger** → **Incident response plan**.
2. Enter `cloud-agent-handover-review` as the plan name, then select the
   SRE Agent configured for this scenario as the response custom agent.
3. Set the incident filter to match only this scenario:
   - **Severity:** **Sev2** (Severity 2).
   - **Title contains:** `Unfinished feature returns HTTP 500`.
4. Set **Agent autonomy level** to **Review**. Do not select **Autonomous**.
5. Keep **Reinvestigation cooldown** enabled at its default duration of three
   hours. During this window, another firing of the same Azure Monitor alert
   is merged into or reopens the existing investigation thread. Workshop
   scenarios do not require a separate investigation for every firing.
6. Preview the matching incidents, then select **Create**.
7. In the incident response plans list, confirm that
   `cloud-agent-handover-review` is **On** and shows the **Sev2** and title
   filters, **Review** autonomy, and a three-hour reinvestigation cooldown.

In **Review** mode, the agent investigates and presents its evidence before
the learner explicitly approves creation of one unassigned GitHub issue. The
learner reviews the created issue and assigns Copilot. Do not enable a plan
that permits issue creation without review. The operational-guidelines
knowledge file remains the handover contract.

## Confirm Copilot assignment

Setup already performs this read-only check. To repeat it:

```bash
OWNER="<owner>"
NAME="<repository>"
gh api graphql \
  -f query='query($owner:String!,$name:String!){repository(owner:$owner,name:$name){suggestedActors(capabilities:[CAN_BE_ASSIGNED],first:100){nodes{login}}}}' \
  -f owner="$OWNER" \
  -f name="$NAME" \
  --jq '.data.repository.suggestedActors.nodes[].login'
```

Confirm that the output includes `copilot-swe-agent`.

GitHub displays this assignee as **Copilot** in the web interface. The API and
operational-guidelines login is `copilot-swe-agent`; it identifies the GitHub
Copilot coding agent, not the Azure SRE Agent.
