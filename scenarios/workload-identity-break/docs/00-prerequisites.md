# Module 0: Prerequisites

## Overview

Before starting the workshop, you'll need an active Azure subscription, a few command-line tools, a GitHub account, and a handful of credentials. This module walks through each requirement and shows you how to validate your setup. Estimated time: **15 minutes of reading + 10 minutes of configuration**.

## Cost Estimate

The **high** profile is a qualitative cost estimate. The dominant cost drivers
are the two-node AKS cluster, Cosmos DB, Application Insights and Log Analytics
ingestion, and Azure SRE Agent usage. Confirm current regional pricing before
provisioning, set an appropriate budget or alert for your subscription, and run
cleanup immediately after completing the scenario.

## Requirements

### 1. Azure Subscription

- **Required deployment role:** Contributor on the subscription, to register
  resource providers and create the workshop resources.
- **Required access-management role:** Owner or User Access Administrator at
  subscription scope. This is required because SRE Agent setup creates managed
  identity role assignments for the selected Azure resources and grants
  Monitoring Contributor at subscription scope; Contributor cannot create
  those role assignments.
- **Check your access:** Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and verify you can see your subscription
- **Resource Providers**: Ensure the required resource providers are registered. Run `setup.sh` or `setup.ps1` to verify.

### 2. Supported Azure Region

The SRE Agent is available in specific regions. You **must** deploy this workshop to one of these three:

- **East US 2**
- **Sweden Central**
- **Australia East**

> When deploying infrastructure (Module 1), you'll specify your region. Pick the one closest to you or your team for lowest latency.

### 3. Network Access

Your network must allow outbound HTTPS traffic to:
- `*.azuresre.ai` (SRE Agent portal and services)
- `*.azurerm.com` (Azure API endpoints)
- `ghcr.io` (GitHub Container Registry, for the container image)

Most corporate networks allow this by default. If you're behind a strict firewall, contact your network team.

### 4. Required Tools

#### Azure CLI (`az`)

[Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) — the command-line interface for managing Azure resources.

**Quick check:**
```bash
az --version
```

#### kubectl

[Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) — the command-line interface for Kubernetes.

**Quick check:**
```bash
kubectl version --client
```

#### GitHub CLI (`gh`)

[Install GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) — optional but helpful for testing GitHub connectivity.

**Quick check:**
```bash
gh --version
```

#### Docker (optional)

Not required for this workshop (we use a pre-built container image), but helpful if you want to inspect or modify the web app locally.

### 5. GitHub Account

- You must have a GitHub account that can create a repository from a template
- The generated repository must have **Issues** and **Actions** enabled
- Your account or organization must have the **Copilot coding agent** enabled
- You need repository administrator access to configure Actions secrets and variables
- [Sign up for free here](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have an account

## Step 1: Generate Your Repository

Create an independent repository from the workshop template, configure it with
your Azure credentials, and run deployments against your Azure subscription.

**Steps:**

1. Open the repository creation form with [**Use this template**](https://github.com/JoranBergfeld/sre-agent-workshop/generate).
2. Choose your personal account or organization, name the repository, and create it.
3. Verify **Issues** and **Actions** are enabled and the Copilot coding agent is available.
4. Clone the generated repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/{OWNER}/{GENERATED_REPOSITORY}.git
   cd {GENERATED_REPOSITORY}
   ```

Copilot will author pull requests in this generated repository after the SRE
Agent receives approval, creates one issue, and assigns it to `@copilot`.

## Step 2: Create a Service Principal for GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions workflows in the generated repository need credentials to deploy infrastructure to your Azure subscription. We'll create a service principal with Contributor access to your subscription.

### Get Your Subscription ID

```bash
az login
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>"
az account set --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
az account show --query '{name:name,id:id}' --output table
```

Keep this terminal open — you'll use `$SUBSCRIPTION_ID` in the next step.

### Set the Canonical Workload Names

Set these once after selecting the subscription and reuse them in every module.
Replace the default workload only if you need a unique name; the resource group
must remain derived from the same value.

**Bash**

```bash
WORKLOAD_NAME="srelabidentity"
RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-${WORKLOAD_NAME}"
```

**PowerShell**

```powershell
$WorkloadName = "srelabidentity"
$ResourceGroup = "rg-${WorkloadName}"
```

### Create a Service Principal

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name "sre-workshop-sp" \
  --role Contributor \
  --scopes /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  --json-auth
```

> **⚠️ Tenant policy note:** Some Azure AD tenants enforce credential lifetime policies that may cause this command to fail. If you see an error about credential expiry or policy restrictions, reset the service principal credentials with a shorter lifetime:
>
> ```bash
> az ad sp credential reset --name "sre-workshop-sp" --years 1
> ```
>
> Always delete the service principal when done with the workshop (see Module 7).

This command outputs a JSON block containing the service principal credentials. **Copy the entire JSON output** — you'll paste it into GitHub next.

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Actions Secrets

The generated repository needs the service principal credentials as a GitHub Actions secret. Anyone with write access can trigger workflows, so treat this secret with care.

**Steps:**

1. Go to the generated repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add this secret:

| Secret Name | Value | How to get it |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` | The full JSON block from the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command | Run the command above and copy the entire JSON output |

> **Security note:** GitHub encrypts these secrets in transit and at rest. They're only exposed to workflows running in your repository and cannot be read back via the GitHub UI.

## Step 4: Configure Repository Variables (Optional)

Repository variables provide defaults for the scenario workflows. While deployment workflows always let you pick the region and workload name explicitly, setting these variables keeps the scenario defaults aligned with your environment.

**Steps:**

1. Go to the generated repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Switch to the **Variables** tab
4. Click **New repository variable** and add these variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Description |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| `WORKLOAD_NAME` | Your chosen workload name (e.g., `srelabidentity`) | Used in resource naming — should match what you used in Module 1 and be unique |
| `AZURE_LOCATION` | Your chosen Azure region (e.g., `eastus2`) | Should match the region used in Module 1 |

> **Why this matters:** `Validate Workload Identity Break Infrastructure` runs automatically when you push Bicep changes or open a PR. It validates the capsule's Bicep syntax. `Deploy Workload Identity Break Infrastructure` uses these variables as defaults when you manually run it.

## Step 5: Verify Your Setup

Run these commands to confirm everything is ready:

```bash
# Verify Azure CLI and authentication
az login
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>"
az account set --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
az account show --query '{name:name,id:id}' --output table

# Verify kubectl
kubectl version --client

# Verify GitHub CLI (optional)
gh auth status

# Verify the generated repository is cloned
cd {GENERATED_REPOSITORY}
git remote -v  # should show the generated repository as origin
```

**Expected output:**
- `az account show` displays your subscription name and ID
- `kubectl version --client` shows a version number (e.g., v1.28.0)
- `gh auth status` shows "Logged in to github.com..." (if installed)
- `git remote -v` shows the generated repository URL for both fetch and push

## Cost Reminder

You're about to provision a **high** cost-profile scenario. Confirm current
regional pricing and your subscription budget before continuing. When you're
done, **run the cleanup steps in Module 7** to delete all resources and stop
incurring charges.
