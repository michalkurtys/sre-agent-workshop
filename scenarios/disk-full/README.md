# Scenario: Disk Full (C: Pressure)

> Scenario: `disk-full` · Azure Virtual Machines · Storage capacity

Run every command below from the repository root. This self-contained capsule
deploys two Windows Server VMs with IIS, Azure Monitor, Azure Bastion, and the
single scheduled-query alert that detects C: free-space pressure.

The default workload is `srelabdiskfull`. For a separate deployment, choose a
unique workload name such as `srelabdiskfulljordan`; use that same name in every
command and derive VM and Bastion names from it (`<workload>-vm01` and
`<workload>-bas`). The ARM VM names are deliberately separate from the
Windows computer names: VM 01 reports Perf data as `sredisk01` and VM 02 as
`sredisk02`, both within Windows' 15-character computer-name limit. Do not
reuse the previous VM workshop workload name.

## Cost profile

The **high** profile is a qualitative cost estimate. The dominant cost drivers
are two Windows VMs, Standard Azure Bastion, Application Insights and Log
Analytics ingestion, and Azure SRE Agent usage. Confirm current pricing for
your deployment region before provisioning, and run cleanup immediately after
completing the scenario.

## Capsule commands

```bash
./scenarios/disk-full/scripts/setup.sh
./scenarios/disk-full/scripts/inject.sh
./scenarios/disk-full/scripts/validate.sh
```

```powershell
./scenarios/disk-full/scripts/setup.ps1
./scenarios/disk-full/scripts/inject.ps1
./scenarios/disk-full/scripts/validate.ps1
```

The injector writes 1 GB files under `C:\Temp\diskfill` until the C: drive
cannot accept another file. The direct alert in
`infra/bicep/modules/alert.bicep` fires when `% Free Space` is below 10%.

## Incident and remediation flow

The normal recovery path is exactly:

**incident evidence → one GitHub issue assigned to `@copilot` → Copilot PR →
human review and merge → controlled Bicep deployment by an authorized human**.

The Bicep deployment corrects the desired state. Direct remediation is an
approved manual fallback only when that path cannot restore service in time.
It must use the scenario-owned approval gate, a `CHG-` or `INC-` ticket, and
the exact `APPROVE` confirmation:

```bash
./scenarios/disk-full/tools/invoke-approved-remediation.sh \
  --action cleanup-disk \
  --resource-group rg-srelabdiskfull \
  --vm-name srelabdiskfull-vm01 \
  --change-ticket CHG-12345
```

```powershell
./scenarios/disk-full/tools/Invoke-ApprovedRemediation.ps1 `
  -Action cleanup-disk `
  -ResourceGroup rg-srelabdiskfull `
  -VmName srelabdiskfull-vm01 `
  -ChangeTicket CHG-12345
```

The gate appends approved executions to `output/actions-audit.log`.
